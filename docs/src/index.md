*There are many excellent courses on the Julia Language. We once heard saying that you understand a language if you can explain it to somebody else, so this is the main goal of the course.*

*Our example in the course is an elderly monitoring system. Raspberry Pi Zero W's are used to take pictures of a room once per five seconds. When there is a considerable change in the photograph, the Zero notifies the central system. The central system, which consists of a Raspberry Pi 3B, retrieves the image from the camera-unit and analyses it. It sends a report to a system in the cloud. Relatives can watch the results on the server in the cloud.*
