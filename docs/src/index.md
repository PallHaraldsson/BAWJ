## Preface

In July 2018, I read an article about a new programming language that was rapidly gaining in popularity, Julia. It appealed to me how you defined a function. Almost exactly as I learned it during my bachelor study Electronics: f(x) = 2xÂ² + 3x + 1 => 2x^2 + 3x + 1. Then I set up a project to find out how to implement the observer pattern. It was easy for me, but I left it out because I was working on Scala at that moment.

While working with Scala, I got acquainted with the Ports and Adapter Design Pattern. It's also called the Onion Pattern. I also used it in the pilot project. The ease with which I could build applications with Julia stayed with me.

A recruiter told me at the beginning of 2019 that the interest in Scala in the Netherlands was waning.  Should I continue with Scala?

The course was born
I decided to stop with Scala and picked up the Julia observer project again. From the code, I finally made a Julia package, RbO.jl. It turned out that I could make the documentation for the package Documenter.jl. You write it in the markdown language and can insert examples of how to use your code. During the creation of the HTML code, you can have the cases tested, which is useful if you later expand the module and generate the documentation again.

The documentation is visible through the GitHub Pages. I had already set up my profile, but thought: "Why set up the AppliGate website in this way and link it to my profile." I did it: https://www,appligate.nl.

With trying out so many things, the problem soon arose that at a certain point, I could not find certain discoveries back in my notes. After the success of the website, I thought: "Why not set up a course where I can register all the interesting things?".

The result is this course Building Business Applications with Julia.
